I have a grid of images. The image grid is UY x UX, and each image is YxX. These
parameters are set in the "scene config" dictionary.

Then I have a collection of atoms or test points, set by the "atom
config" dictionary.

Each atom is generating a gaussian in each image. The exact location of the gaussian
in each image is determined by the atom's (x, y, z) in real space, as well
as which image in the UY x UX grid we are rendering.

Now, I have data consisting of an image set. I need to compute the inner
product of "the image set generated by atom i" with the image.

If you're familiar with linear inverse problems, I have a true set of
points x, a linear operator A, and image data y. I am trying to compute x = A^Ty
as part of a much-larger linear inverse systems solver.

The problem is, of course, this is all quite intensive and slow, even using
the python scientific computing libs coupled with the numab JIT engine.

Because my kernel is separable, computing this dot product can be
segmented into the independent X and Y parts, and we can apply them independently.
